/**
 * @page stability_committed Committed Interfaces
 * @brief List of the committed interfaces.
 *
 * A committed interface is the highest grade of stability, and is the preferred attribute level for consumers of the library.
 *
 * Couchbase tries at best effort to preserve committed interfaces between major versions, and changes to committed interfaces within a
 * major version is highly exceptional. Such exceptions may include situations where the interface may lead to data corruption, security
 * holes etc. Explicitly note that backwards-compatible extensions are always allowed since they don't break old code.
 *
 * @note This is the default interface level for an API, unless the API is specifically marked otherwise.

/**
 * @page stability_volatile Volatile Interfaces
 * @brief List of the volatile interfaces.
 *
 * Types/Methods/Interfaces marked as volatile can change any time and for any reason.
 *
 * They may be volatile for reasons including:
 *
 * * Depends on specific implementation detail within the library which may change in the response.
 * * Depends on specific implementation detail within the server which may change in the response.
 * * Has been introduced as part of a trial phase for the specific feature.

/**
 * @page stability_uncommitted Uncommitted Interfaces
 * @brief List of the uncommitted interfaces.
 *
 * No commitment is made about the interface.
 *
 * It may be changed in incompatible ways and dropped from one release to another. The difference between an uncommitted interface and a
 * @ref stability_volatile "volatile" interface is its maturity and likelihood of being changed. Uncommitted interfaces may mature into @ref
 * stability_committed "committed" interfaces.

/**
 * @page stability_internal Internal Interfaces
 * @brief List of the internal interfaces.
 *
 * This is internal API and may not be relied on at all.
 *
 * Similar to @ref stability_volatile "volatile" interfaces, no promises are made about these kinds of interfaces and they change or may
 * vanish at every point in time. But in addition to that, those interfaces are explicitly marked as being designed for internal use and not
 * for external consumption in the first place.
 *
 * @warning Use at your own risk
